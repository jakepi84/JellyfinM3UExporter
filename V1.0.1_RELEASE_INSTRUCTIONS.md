# v1.0.1 Release Instructions

## Current Status

This PR has prepared the repository for a proper v1.0.1 release:

### Changes Made

1. ✅ **Updated build.yaml** - Version changed from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.1.0 with updated changelog
2. ✅ **Fixed manifest.json** - Corrected sourceUrl to point to the existing v1.0.0 release
3. ✅ **Verified Directory.Build.props** - Already has version 1.0.1.0
4. ✅ **Updated README** - Added proper release process documentation
5. ✅ **Tested build locally** - Confirmed plugin builds correctly as version 1.0.1.0

### What This Fixes

Previously, a v1.0.1 tag was created before the version files were updated, which caused:
- The workflow to build version 1.0.0.0 instead of 1.0.1.0
- manifest.json to be incorrectly updated with version 1.0.0.0 pointing to v1.0.1 URL
- No actual v1.0.1 release to be created

## Next Steps

After this PR is merged to main, follow these steps to create the v1.0.1 release:

### 1. Merge This PR

Merge this PR to the main branch either through GitHub UI or locally:

```bash
# If merging locally
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge copilot/update-github-actions-v101
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create and Push the v1.0.1 Tag

From the main branch (after merge):

```bash
# Ensure you're on main with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create the v1.0.1 tag
git tag v1.0.1

# Push the tag to trigger the workflow
git push origin v1.0.1
```

### 3. Verify the GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/jakepi84/JellyfinM3UExporter/actions)
2. You should see a "Publish Plugin" workflow running for the v1.0.1 tag
3. Wait for the workflow to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

The workflow will:
- ✅ Build the plugin with version 1.0.1.0
- ✅ Create a properly formatted ZIP file: `m3u-exporter_1.0.1.0.zip`
- ✅ Add version 1.0.1.0 to manifest.json with the correct URL
- ✅ Create a GitHub release at v1.0.1 with all artifacts
- ✅ Commit the updated manifest.json back to main

### 4. Verify the Release

1. Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/jakepi84/JellyfinM3UExporter/releases)
2. You should see a new v1.0.1 release with:
   - `m3u-exporter_1.0.1.0.zip` - The plugin package
   - `m3u-exporter_1.0.1.0.zip.md5` - MD5 checksum
   - `m3u-exporter_1.0.1.0.zip.sha256` - SHA256 checksum
   - `manifest.json` - Updated manifest file

### 5. Verify the Manifest

Check that manifest.json now contains both versions:
- v1.0.0.0 pointing to v1.0.0 release
- v1.0.1.0 pointing to v1.0.1 release

You can view it at: https://github.com/jakepi84/JellyfinM3UExporter/raw/main/manifest.json

## Alternative: Manual Workflow Trigger

If you prefer not to create the tag directly, you can manually trigger the workflow:

1. Go to the [Publish Plugin workflow](https://github.com/jakepi84/JellyfinM3UExporter/actions/workflows/publish.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter tag: `v1.0.1`
4. Click "Run workflow"

## Plugin Installation

After the v1.0.1 release is created, users can install it:

### Via Plugin Repository (Recommended)

Users can add this repository as a plugin source in Jellyfin:

1. Repository URL: `https://github.com/jakepi84/JellyfinM3UExporter/raw/main/manifest.json`
2. Jellyfin will automatically show both v1.0.0.0 and v1.0.1.0 versions
3. Users can upgrade from v1.0.0.0 to v1.0.1.0 through the Jellyfin UI

### Manual Installation

Users can download the `m3u-exporter_1.0.1.0.zip` from the v1.0.1 release and extract it to their Jellyfin plugins directory.

## Cleanup

After successfully creating the v1.0.1 release, you may want to delete these temporary documentation files:
- `FIX_V1.0.1_TAG.md`
- `RELEASE_FIX_GUIDE.md`
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`
- `V1.0.1_RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (this file)

These were created to document the issues and their fixes but are no longer needed once v1.0.1 is released.
